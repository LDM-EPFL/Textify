Textify!
====================
Text display and manipulation software developed for [*CYBORGAME*](andrewsempere.org/cyborgame).

This software was developed as part of my PhD work [*Building Consciousness*](http://andrewsempere.org/buildingConsciousness)
It is released with the MIT License, but if you do something neat with it, let me know?
